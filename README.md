# Friend-Finder
Friend Finder finds compatability among the user and different "friends," who have previously submitted scores. To initialize Friend Finder, the user types in their name and uploads a picture and then answers 10 questions. Each question is scaled from 1-5. After pressing "submit," Friend Finder calculates the score and compares scores with the friends who have previously answered. Friend-Finder operates similar to a "dating app."
