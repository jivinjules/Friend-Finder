To initialize Friend Finder, the user types in their name and uploads a picture and then answers 10 questions. Each question is scaled from 1-5. After pressing \"submit,\" Friend Finder calculates the score and compares scores with the friends who have previously answered. Friend-Finder operates similar to a \"dating app.\"",
